# What is Programming?

Programming is the task of creating instructions so that a computer can perform a task for you.  

At the highest level programming has two steps: design a solution to a problem, then encode the solution so a computer can do the work. The first part is a challenge for creative logic, the second a challenge for language. Programming a computer takes more of our imagination and creativity than it does of our cold, hard logic or mathematics. 

This guide is intended to help a beginner reach an understanding of how to design a solution to a problem in such a way that it can later be translated into a programming language. No coding in a programming language is demonstrated in this guide, instead the guide focuses on the building blocks of solutions for programming: sequences, loops, events, conditions, and on the key computational thinking practices: experimentation and iteration, testing, re-use and abstraction. In this guide we use a graphical tool called Scratch to create and apply these concepts in a computer.

The guide aims to teach an understanding of the way that programs are built, before we understand how programs are encoded in a language.

> This is not going to go the way you think.

Be prepared, this is not a typical programming course. It will be a largely self led exploration of concepts and ideas, not a slog through syntax and rote copying. If you've seen a programming guide before, forget it. Here your best tools will be your imagination, a notebook, a friend and your powers of reflection and criticism. This guide will be your research partner in the exploration helping you to reveal the fundamental concepts of programming.

For this course you will need. 

1. A computer with an internet connection
2. A notebook
3. A friend (actually this is optional, but will be helpful).
